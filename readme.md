## Parliamentary Education Census

Can we build a tool to allow people to find MPs with relevant training/expertise/affiliations to help support campaigns/initiatives?

For example, this tool could find all the MPs that studied RSE-adjacent degrees, to identify potential political support for future SSI initiatives.

This is a project to:

1. Create a dataset of which universities MPs have attended, and what subjects they have studied.
2. Explore that dataset
