## Parliamentary Education Census

Can we build a tool to allow people to find MPs with relevant training/expertise/affiliations to help support campaigns/initiatives?

For example, this tool could find all the MPs that studied RSE-adjacent degrees, to identify potential political support for future SSI initiatives.

This is a project to:

1. Create a dataset of which universities MPs have attended, and what subjects they have studied.
2. Explore that dataset

# Introduction

There are 650 MPs elected to the UK Houses of Parliament. Although there is lots of open data available about MPs (eg https://www.theyworkforyou.com/) the majority of it is focused on what they DO within parliament, rather than their backgrounds/skills/experience.

The UK university sector is in crisis with 50+ institutions currently going through redundancies. Pushing back against cuts requires coalitions of academics/university staff, politicians, funders and policymakers to make the case for the power/value of research.

(N.B - Not every politician should be university educated and this project is not about arguing that every MP needs a degree, but more to study the cohort of those that do)

# Examples

Concrete examples of what the data can be used for and how it can be consulted once everything is running.

# How to install

Using venv or poetry or whatever else people may need to make that thing work - package everything up in library format? Is that feasible?

# How to get started

What to do more specifically in order to be able to consult the data.

# How to get support

How will problems/concerns/comments/feedback addressed?

# How to contribute

What's the project's governance re contribution from folks?

# Documentation

How is this project documented?

# Citing

How shall it be cited?
